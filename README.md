# Smart-Contract - FundMe
A FundMe smart contract, written in Solidity, is a blockchain-based solution designed to facilitate crowdfunding and fundraising activities with transparency and security. Utilizing Solidity's robust programming language, 
FundMe contracts automatically handle the collection and distribution of funds. Contributors can trust that their donations will only be released to the project when predefined conditions are met, enhancing accountability 
and trust in the crowdfunding process. Solidity's smart contracts offer an immutable and decentralized platform for managing funds, reducing the need for intermediaries, and ensuring a fair and transparent fundraising experience 
for all parties involved.

<ul>
  <li>Fund the contract</li>
  <li>Minimum fund/deposit is 10 USD</li>
  <li>Get ETH current latest price</li>
  <li>Only the owner of the contract can withdraw the ETH</li>
</ul>

## ChainLink 

Chainlink is a decentralized oracle network that provides smart contracts on blockchain platforms with access to real-world data and external APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Oracles, in the context of blockchain and smart 
contracts, serve as bridges between the on-chain and off-chain worlds. They enable smart contracts to interact with data and systems outside of their native blockchain, making it possible to integrate real-world information and events 
into blockchain-based applications.
The Chainlink network is decentralized and secure, relying on a network of independent node operators, known as Chainlink nodes, to fetch and verify external data before transmitting it to smart contracts. These nodes use cryptographic 
techniques to ensure data accuracy and security.
